# Cookie Consent: an Eager App
This Eager app is based on silktide's cookie consent tool. You can view silktide's code [on github](https://github.com/silktide/cookieconsent2) or visit their [web page](https://silktide.com/tools/cookie-consent/) to learn more. 

The app adds an alert to a webpage informing visitors of the website's use of cookies, thus satisfying the requirements of the EU cookie law. Eager users can customize several elements including position, color scheme, alert text, and more.
